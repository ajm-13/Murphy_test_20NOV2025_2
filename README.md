Hello, this repo will stand as a test template for future projects I will be working on

It will be organized with 2-3 branches, one being the main, the other being a developer, and I am still working on the third

Additionally, the main branch will hold the code, the data, and any other supplemental information 

Please feel free to contact me via GitHub if you have any questions
